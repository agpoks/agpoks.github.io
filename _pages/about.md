I am a mechanical engineer with a PhD from TU Wien and a strong interdisciplinary background in electrical engineering, control systems, and vehicle dynamics. 

I have a strong industry background with experience as a software developer at ZIEHL-ABEGG SE for 8 years, where I focused on embedded systems, drive control algorithms, and system simulations. From 2019 to 2025, I worked as a research and teaching assistant at the Institute of Mechanics and Mechatronics at TU Wien. My doctoral research on predictive control for electric refrigerated vehicles combined physics-based modeling, model predictive control (MPC), and neural networks, in close collaboration with industrial partners such as PBX GmbH, ZOERKLER Gears, and KTM.

I have designed experimental test benches, conducted extensive lab measurements, and published my results in peer-reviewed journals. I was also actively involved in acquiring third-party funding and initiating new research projects. In my teaching activies at TU Wien, I have taught courses on control systems, supervised numerous theses, and guided students through exercises and labs. I am passionate about bridging theory and practice, supporting students, and advancing research in dynamic systems and control.

Beyond research, I contribute to the autonomous vehicle student group Scuderia Segfault, applying ML techniques to real-world driving scenarios.
