Rewarding days at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Atlanta GA filled with insightful conversations and new ideas from researchers and students around the world.

It was also great to see Scuderia Segfault of Technische Universität Wien place 4th in the The Roboracer Foundation autonomous vehicle competition—an exciting challenge and a strong result for the team.
